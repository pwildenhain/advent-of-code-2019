    "# Day 5\n",
    "\n",
    ">You're starting to sweat as the ship makes its way toward Mercury. The Elves suggest that you get the air conditioner working by upgrading your ship computer to support the Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) starts by running a diagnostic program (your puzzle input). The TEST diagnostic program will run on your existing Intcode computer after a few modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    ">First, you'll need to add two new instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Opcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the address given by its only parameter. For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.\n",
    ">- Opcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter. For example, the instruction 4,50 would output the value at address 50.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Second, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, position mode, which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory.\n",
    ">- Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, immediate mode. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, like parameter modes, function correctly. For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful. Non-zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that when we are running the intcode each time that it outputs a non-zero value, we need to halt the program. Otherwise, if it outputs zero (the end of the diagnostic test) then we can continue running the program until...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Finally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully."
